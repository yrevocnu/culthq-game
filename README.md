# culthq-game

Interactive fiction game about an encounter with a mysterious cult. Or maybe it is not a cult.

## How it's made

This game is written using [Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/index.html).

## How to playtest

 - Find the most recent distribution .zip appropriate to your operating system.
 - Unzip that thing.
 - Run `YrevocnuCultHQ.exe` or `.py` or `.sh` according to your fancy
 
## How to develop

 - [Download Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org/latest.html) and familiarize yourself with the launcher. Install a Ren'Py text editor extension if you like.
 - You should wind up with a directory like `renpy-7.0.0/` with a directory `renpy-7.0.0-sdk` inside it.
 - Clone this repository into `renpy-7.0.0/`, next to the SDK directory.
 - Download the image and music from the `dev/` directory on the Google Drive. (Ask S. Benthall for link and access.)
 - Put the `images/` and `music/` directories and content into the `game/` directory
 - Run the Ren'Py launcher. Hopefully the Yrevocnu CultHQ project is listed in the PROJECTS: menu.
